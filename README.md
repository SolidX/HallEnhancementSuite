## Hall Enhancement Suite

A small utility used by the nice folks over at OTSS to happyify their daily Hall experience.

#### Features:
   - Automatic greentexting _(neato!)_
   - 'SFW' Mode _(don't want no one seeing all those nasty gifs, now)_
   - Message Minimization _(I didn't want to read that anyway)_

---

#### Coming soon:
   - Pivotal Tracker Story Linking _(because copy/paste is really that hard)_
   - Nonsensification _(don't ask)_
   - OTSS.Alert Integration? _(seriously, don't ask)_
   
---

#### How To Use

Right now, the easiest way is to copy/paste the code into your console on the Hall page.
Alternatively, copy/paste the lastest version of the code into a bookmark, surrounded by:
```javascript
javascript:(function(){
  //paste code here
})()
```

#####Coming soon: Chrome Plugin, maybe?
