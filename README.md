## Hall Enhancement Suite

A small utility used by the nice folks over at OTSS to happyify their daily Hall experience.

#### Features:
   - Automatic greentexting _(neato!)_
   - 'SFW' Mode _(don't want no one seeing all those nasty gifs, now)_
   - Message Minimization _(I didn't want to read that anyway)_
   - Pivotal Tracker Story Linking _(because copy/paste is really that hard)_
   
---

#### Coming soon:
   - Nonsensification _(don't ask)_
   - OTSS.Alert Integration? _(seriously, don't ask)_
   
---

#### How To Use

The easiest way to install the HES is to add it as a user script on GreaseMonkey or something similar. This will automatically load the HES every time you visit the Hall website.
If your browser doesn't support user scripts (or if you only want to load it once), copy/paste the code into your browser's console on the Hall page.
Alternatively, copy/paste the lastest version of the code into a bookmark, surrounded by:
```javascript
javascript:(function(){
  //paste code here
})()
```

#####Coming soon: Chrome Plugin, maybe?
